## General Information - Provide general information about your project here. - What is the background of your project? -- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. - What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? To check the accurately of detect melanoma - What is the dataset that is being used? Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration dataset 

## Conclusions - Conclusion 
#### **Findings from Model 3** Accuracy of training and validation has been increased significantly due to augmentation and class imbalnce handling. The model is not overfitting. 

This model can be used as final model.
